# SmartBus+

SmartBus+ is a simple Python-based prototype developed to demonstrate bus arrival time prediction using simulated data.

## Project Objective
To reduce uncertainty for public transport users by providing estimated bus arrival times through a lightweight system.

## Technology Used
- Python
- Streamlit

## Note
This project is a prototype created for academic and hackathon purposes using sample data. No real-time tracking or external APIs are used.
